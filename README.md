# FLASK with REACT


This is my first flask application. It seems flask is "flat", without much magic things, as always said. I like the structure of it. 


I mostly use mega flask resource. I was leaving it for future days always, now at least I go over it. Here is the link to the blog of [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database)


I m thinking to do image gallery with *flask-restful* package if I could make it in time. 


For React side, I use *redux-saga*. I don't like to work with promises, if needed i could learn though. Everything related to api and redux state is within store dir. I like this file structure. I have read that there is more concise way of writing redux things with createSlice logic but I still haven't tried it.


Maybe I should generate React pages from index.html but still haven't tried it.
